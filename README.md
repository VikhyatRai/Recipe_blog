The project is a simple blog website where users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blogs. It allows users to add new blogs, update existing ones, delete blogs, and also upload images for their blogs. The blog data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend.

Tech Stack Used:

Frontend:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
CSS: Styling language for designing the appearance of web pages.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
Backend:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
Express: Web framework for Node.js to build robust and scalable web applications.
Database:

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and managing blog data.
Steps to Run the Project Locally:

Clone the Project:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Run the following command to clone the project from the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the project repository.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd <project-folder>
Replace <project-folder> with the name of the folder where the project was cloned.

Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
Copy code
npm install
Set Up MongoDB:

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine.
Create a MongoDB database for the project.
Start the Server:

Run the following command to start the Node.js server:
Copy code
node app.js
You should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (e.g., "Server is running on port 4000").

Access the Website:

Open your web browser.
Navigate to http://localhost:4000 (or the port mentioned in the server message) to access the blog website.
Additional Setup Instructions (if needed):

If you encounter any errors or issues during setup or running the project, refer to the error messages in the terminal or console for troubleshooting.
Make sure you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed (Node.js, npm, MongoDB) before running the project.
For any database-related configurations or changes, refer to the MongoDB documentation or consult your database administrator.
Customize the project as needed, such as modifying the UI, adding new features, or extending the functionality according to your requirements.
